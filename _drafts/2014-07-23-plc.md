IEC 61131-3 specifies syntax and semantics of programming languages for programmable controllers.

> **A Programmable Logic Controller**, PLC or Programmable Controller is a digital computer used for automation of typically industrial electromechanical processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or light fixtures.

This part of IEC 61131 specifies the syntax and semantics of a unified suite of programming languages for programmable controllers (PCs):

1. Two textual languages, IL (Instruction List) and ST (Structured Text)
2. Two graphical languages, LD (Ladder Diagram) and FBD (Function Block Diagram)

> *Sequential Function Chart (SFC) elements* are defined for structuring the internal organization of programmable controller programs and function blocks. 

> Also, *configuration* elements are defined which support the installation of programmable controller programs into programmable controller systems.

A programmable controller program complying with the requirements of IEC 61131-3:

1. shall use only those features specified in this standard for the particular language used;
2. shall not use any features identified as extensions to the language;
3. shall not rely on any particular interpretation of implementation-dependent features.

# General

## Definitions

**aggregate**: structured collection of data objects forming a data type.

**array**: aggregate that consists of data objects, with identical attributes, each of which may be uniquely referenced by subscripting.

**assignment**: mechanism to give a value to a variable or to an aggregate.

**comment**: language construct for the inclusion of text in a program and having no impact on the execution of the program.

**data type**: set of values together with a set of permitted operations.

**declaration**: the mechanism for establishing the definition of a language element.

**delimiter**: character or combination of characters used to separate program language elements.

**direct representation**: means of representing a variable in a programmable controller program from which a manufacturer-specified correspondence to a physical or logical location may be determined directly.

**evaluation**: the process of establishing a value for an expression or a function, or for the outputs of a network or function block, during program execution.

**literal**: lexical unit that directly represents a value.

**pragma**: language construct for the inclusion of text in a program organization unit which may affect the preparation of the program for execution.

**retentive data**: data stored in such a way that its value remains unchanged after a power down / power up sequence.

**semantics**: the relationships between the symbolic elements of a programming language and their meanings, interpretation and use.

## Software Model

In PLC software model, a *configuration* is the language element which corresponds to a programmable controller system. A **resource** corresponds to a "signal processing function" and its "man- machine interface" and "sensor and actuator interface" function (if any).

A *configuration contains* one or more *resources*, each of which contains one or more *programs* executed under the control of zero or more *tasks*. A *program* may contain zero or more *function blocks* or other language elements.

## Communication Model

Variable values *within a program* can be communicated directly by connection of the output of one program element to the input of another.

Variable values can be communicated *between programs in the same configuration* via global variables.

Values of variables can be communicated between different parts of a program, between programs in the same or different configurations, or between a programmable controller program and a non-programmable controller system, using the communication function blocks.

In addition, *programmable controllers or non-programmable controller systems* can transfer data which is made available by *access paths*.
