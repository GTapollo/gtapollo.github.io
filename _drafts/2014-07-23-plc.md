IEC 61131-3 specifies syntax and semantics of programming languages for programmable controllers.

> **A Programmable Logic Controller**, PLC or Programmable Controller is a digital computer used for automation of typically industrial electromechanical processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or light fixtures.

This part(part 3) of IEC 61131 specifies the syntax and semantics of a unified suite of programming languages for programmable controllers (PCs):

1. Two textual languages, IL (Instruction List) and ST (Structured Text)
2. Two graphical languages, LD (Ladder Diagram) and FBD (Function Block Diagram)

> *Sequential Function Chart (SFC) elements* are defined for structuring the internal organization of programmable controller programs and function blocks. 

> Also, *configuration* elements are defined which support the installation of programmable controller programs into programmable controller systems.

A programmable controller program complying with the requirements of IEC 61131-3:

1. shall use only those features specified in this standard for the particular language used;
2. shall not use any features identified as extensions to the language;
3. shall not rely on any particular interpretation of implementation-dependent features.

# General

## Definitions

**aggregate**: structured collection of data objects forming a data type.

**array**: aggregate that consists of data objects, with identical attributes, each of which may be uniquely referenced by subscripting.

**assignment**: mechanism to give a value to a variable or to an aggregate.

**data type**: set of values together with a set of permitted operations.

**declaration**: the mechanism for establishing the definition of a language element.

**delimiter**: character or combination of characters used to separate program language elements.

**direct representation**: means of representing a variable in a programmable controller program from which a manufacturer-specified correspondence to a physical or logical location may be determined directly.

**evaluation**: the process of establishing a value for an expression or a function, or for the outputs of a network or function block, during program execution.

**literal**: lexical unit that directly represents a value.

**retentive data**: data stored in such a way that its value remains unchanged after a power down / power up sequence.

**semantics**: the relationships between the symbolic elements of a programming language and their meanings, interpretation and use.

## Software Model

In PLC software model, a *configuration* is the language element which corresponds to a programmable controller system. A **resource** corresponds to a "signal processing function" and its "man- machine interface" and "sensor and actuator interface" function (if any).

A *configuration contains* one or more *resources*, each of which contains one or more *programs* executed under the control of zero or more *tasks*. A *program* may contain zero or more *function blocks* or other language elements.

## Communication Model

1. Variable values *within a program* can be communicated directly by connection of the output of one program element to the input of another.
2. Variable values can be communicated *between programs in the same configuration* via global variables.
3. Values of variables can be communicated between different parts of a program, between programs in the same or different configurations, or between a programmable controller program and a non-programmable controller system, using the communication function blocks.
4. In addition, *programmable controllers or non-programmable controller systems* can transfer data which is made available by *access paths*.

# Common Elements

This clause defines textual and graphic elements which are common to all the 4 languages.


## Use of Printed Characters

Textual/graphic language **character set** are defined in IOS-646 IRV, with extensions such as Latin-1 Supplement(IOS 10646-1).


An **identifier** is a string of letters, digits, and underline characters which shall begin with a letter or underline character.

* PLC programming languages are case-insensitive. 
* Underlines are significant in identifiers, while multiple underlines are not allowed. 
* At least 6 chars shall be supported

A **commonts** is a language construct for the inclusion of text in a program and having no impact on the execution of the program. *Comments* are delimited by `(*` and `*)`.

> Nested comments shall be treated as an **error**.


A **pragma** is a language construct for the inclusion of text in a program organization unit which may affect the preparation of the program for execution. *Pragmas* are delemited by `{` and `}`.

## External Representation of Data

### Numeric Literals

There are two classes of numeric literals: integer and real. A numeric literal is defined as a decimal number of a based number.

> Single `_` between the digits of a numeric literal shall not be significant. No other use of `_` in numeric literals is allowed.

Examples:

```
-12 0 123_456 +986
-12.0 0.0 0.4560 3.14159_26
-1.34E-12 or -1.34e-12
16#FF or 16#ff (255 decimal)
FALSE TRUE
UINT#16#9AF DINT#5
```

### Character String Literals

Character string literals include single-byte or double-byte encoded characters.

A **single-byte** character string is delimited by `'`, `$` followed by 2 hex digits shall be interpreted as 8-bit character code.

A **double-byte** character string is delimited by `"`, `$` followed by 4 hex digits shall be interpreted as 16-bit character code.

`$` followed by one character shall be interpreted as escape.

Examples:

```
''  'A' '$''    'Ä Ë' == '$C4$CB'
""  "A" "$""    "Ä Ë" == "$00C4$00CB"
STRING#'OK' == WSTRING#'OK'
```

Escaping:

Combination     |   Interpretation
---             |   ---
`$$`            |   Dollar sign
`$'` or `$"`    |   Quotes
`$L` or `$l`    |   Line feed
`$N` or `$n`    |   Newline
`$P` or `$p`    |   Form feed(page)
`$R` or `$r`    |   Carriage return
`$T` or `$t`    |   Tab

### Time Literals

There are two classes of time literals:

1. **duration data** for measuring or controlling the elapsed time of a control event.
2. **time of day data** (which may also include date information) for synchronizing the beginning or end of a control event to an absolute time reference.

* Optional single `_` can be used to separate different time units. 
* "Overflow" of the most significant unit of a duration is permitted.
* The least significant unit can be real without exponent.

Keywords    |   Duration    |   Time
---         |   ---         |   ---
Full        | `TIME`        |   `DATE` `TIME_OF_DAY` `DATE_AND_TIME`
Abbr        |   `T`         |   `D` `TOD` `DT`

Examples:

```
T#14.7h t#5d14h12m18s3.5ms  TIME#-14ms
DATE#1984-06-25 tod#15:36:55.36
date_and_time#1984-06-25-15:36:55.36
```

### Generic Data Types

In addition of *elementari data types*, the **hierarchy of generic data types** can be used in the spec. of input/output of functions and function blocks. Generic data types are identified by the prefix `ANY`.

```
ANY
    ANY_DERIVED
    ANY_ELEMENTARY
        ANY_MAGNITUDE
            ANY_NUM
                ANY_REAL 
                    LREAL
                    REAL 
                ANY_INT
                    LINT, DINT, INT, SINT
                    ULINT, UDINT, UINT, USINT 
            TIME
        ANY_BIT
            LWORD, DWORD, WORD, BYTE, BOOL
        ANY_STRING 
            STRING
            WSTRING 
        ANY_DATE
            DATE_AND_TIME 
            DATE, TIME_OF_DAY
```

### Derived Data Types

**Derived data types** are declared using `TYPE...END_TYPE`. A direct derivation from elementary types looks like: `TYPE RU_REAL : REAL ; END_TYPE`.

#### Enumerated

```
TYPE ANALOG_SIGNAL_TYPE : 
    (SINGLE_ENDED, DIFFERENTIAL) := SINGLE_ENDED ; 
END_TYPE
```

Type prefix `Type#` can be used for **enumerated** data to avoid ambiguousity. It's an **error** if sufficient type information is not provided.

The default initial value of *enumerated* data type shall be the first identifier, or a value specified by `:=`.

#### Subrange

```
TYPE ANALOG_DATA : INT (-4095..4095) ; END_TYPE
```

A **subrange** declaration specifies upper and lower limits of data type. It's an **error** if the value falls outside of the specified range of its type.

The default initial value of *subrange* data type shall be the lower limit of the subrange.

#### Struct

```
TYPE 
    ANALOG_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION :
        STRUCT
            RANGE : ANALOG_SIGNAL_RANGE ; 
            MIN_SCALE : ANALOG_DATA ; 
            MAX_SCALE : ANALOG_DATA ;
        END_STRUCT ; 
    ANALOG_16_INPUT_CONFIGURATION :
        STRUCT
            SIGNAL_TYPE : ANALOG_SIGNAL_TYPE ;
            FILTER_PARAMETER : SINT (0..99) ;
            CHANNEL : ARRAY [1..16] OF ANALOG_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION ;
        END_STRUCT ; 
END_TYPE
```

A **struct** shall contain sub-elements which can be accessed by their names.

For *structs* and *arrays*, the default initial values, unless specified by `:=`, shall be the default value of underlining elementary data types.

> Default initial value for elementary shall be 0, except for `DATE` data type which is `0000-00-01`.

#### Array

```
TYPE ANALOG_16_INPUT_DATA : 
    ARRAY [1..16] OF ANALOG_DATA ; 
END_TYPE
```

The default max length of `STRING` and `WSTRING` are **implementation-dependent** unless specified, such as: `TYPE STR10 : STRING[10] := 'ABCDEF'; END_TYPE`.
