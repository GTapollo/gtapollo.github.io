IEC 61131-3 specifies *syntax* and *semantics* of programming languages for programmable controllers.

> **A Programmable Logic Controller**, **PLC** or **Programmable Controller** is a digital computer used for automation of typically industrial electromechanical processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or light fixtures.

This part(part 3) of IEC 61131 specifies the syntax and semantics of a unified suite of programming languages for *programmable controllers (PCs)*:

1. Two textual languages, *IL (Instruction List)* and *ST (Structured Text)*
2. Two graphical languages, *LD (Ladder Diagram)* and *FBD (Function Block Diagram)*

> *Sequential Function Chart (SFC) elements* are defined for structuring the internal organization of programmable controller programs and function blocks. 

> Also, *configuration* elements are defined which support the installation of programmable controller programs into programmable controller systems.

A programmable controller program *complying* with the requirements of IEC 61131-3:

1. shall use only those features specified in this standard for the particular language used;
2. shall not use any features identified as extensions to the language;
3. shall not rely on any particular interpretation of *implementation-dependent* features.

# General

## Definitions

**aggregate**: structured collection of data objects forming a data type.

**assignment**: mechanism to give a value to a variable or to an aggregate.

**data type**: set of values together with a set of permitted operations.

**declaration**: the mechanism for establishing the definition of a language element.

**delimiter**: character or combination of characters used to separate program language elements.

**evaluation**: the process of establishing a value for an expression or a function, or for the outputs of a network or function block, during program execution.

**literal**: lexical unit that directly represents a value.

**retentive data**: data stored in such a way that its value remains unchanged after a power down / power up sequence.

**semantics**: the relationships between the symbolic elements of a programming language and their meanings, interpretation and use.

## Software Model

In PLC software model, a **configuration** is the language element which corresponds to a programmable controller system. A **resource** corresponds to a "signal processing function" and its "man-machine interface" and "sensor and actuator interface" function (if any).

A *configuration contains* one or more *resources*, each of which contains one or more *programs* executed under the control of zero or more **tasks**. A **program** may contain zero or more **function blocks** or other language elements.

## Communication Model

1. Variable values *within a program* can be communicated directly by connection of the output of one program element to the input of another.
2. Variable values can be communicated *between programs in the same configuration* via global variables.
3. Values of variables can be communicated between different parts of a program, between programs in the same or different configurations, or between a programmable controller program and a non-programmable controller system, using the communication function blocks.
4. In addition, *programmable controllers or non-programmable controller systems* can transfer data which is made available by *access paths*.

# Common Elements

This clause defines textual and graphic elements which are common to all the 4 languages.


## Use of Printed Characters

Textual/graphic language **character set** are defined in IOS-646 IRV, with extensions such as Latin-1 Supplement(IOS 10646-1).


An **identifier** is a string of letters, digits, and underline characters which shall begin with a letter or underline character.

* PLC programming languages are case-insensitive. 
* Underlines are significant in identifiers, while multiple underlines are not allowed. 
* At least 6 chars shall be supported

A **commonts** is a language construct for the inclusion of text in a program and having no impact on the execution of the program. *Comments* are delimited by `(*` and `*)`.

> Nested comments shall be treated as an **error**.


A **pragma** is a language construct for the inclusion of text in a program organization unit which may affect the preparation of the program for execution. *Pragmas* are delimited by `{` and `}`.

## External Representation of Data

### Numeric Literals

There are two classes of numeric literals: integer and real. A numeric literal is defined as a decimal number of a based number.

> Single `_` between the digits of a numeric literal shall not be significant. No other use of `_` in numeric literals is allowed.

Literal examples:

```
-12 0 123_456 +986
-12.0 0.0 0.4560 3.14159_26
-1.34E-12 or -1.34e-12
16#FF or 16#ff (255 decimal)
FALSE TRUE
UINT#16#9AF DINT#5
```

### Character String Literals

Character string literals include single-byte or double-byte encoded characters.

A **single-byte** character string is delimited by `'`, `$` followed by 2 hex digits shall be interpreted as 8-bit character code. A **double-byte** character string is delimited by `"`, `$` followed by 4 hex digits shall be interpreted as 16-bit character code. `$` followed by one character shall be interpreted as escape.

Syntax examples:

```
''  'A' '$''    'Ä Ë' == '$C4$CB'
""  "A" "$""    "Ä Ë" == "$00C4$00CB"
STRING#'OK' == WSTRING#'OK'
```

Escaping:

Combination     |   Interpretation
---             |   ---
`$$`            |   Dollar sign
`$'` or `$"`    |   Quotes
`$L` or `$l`    |   Line feed
`$N` or `$n`    |   Newline
`$P` or `$p`    |   Form feed(page)
`$R` or `$r`    |   Carriage return
`$T` or `$t`    |   Tab

### Time Literals

There are two classes of time literals:

1. **duration** data for measuring or controlling the elapsed time of a control event.
2. **time of day** data (which may also include date information) for synchronizing the beginning or end of a control event to an absolute time reference.

* Optional single `_` can be used to separate different time units. 
* "Overflow" of the most significant unit of a duration is permitted.
* The least significant unit can be real without exponent.

Keywords    |   Duration    |   Time
---         |   ---         |   ---
Full        | `TIME`        |   `DATE` `TIME_OF_DAY` `DATE_AND_TIME`
Abbr        |   `T`         |   `D` `TOD` `DT`

Syntax examples:

```
T#14.7h t#5d14h12m18s3.5ms  TIME#-14ms
DATE#1984-06-25 tod#15:36:55.36
date_and_time#1984-06-25-15:36:55.36
```

21 | `LWORD` | Bit string of length 64 | 64 

### Generic Data Types

In addition of *elementari data types*, the **hierarchy of generic data types** can be used in the specification of input/output of functions and function blocks. Generic data types are identified by the prefix `ANY`.

```
ANY
    ANY_DERIVED
    ANY_ELEMENTARY
        ANY_MAGNITUDE
            ANY_NUM
                ANY_REAL 
                    LREAL
                    REAL 
                ANY_INT
                    LINT, DINT, INT, SINT
                    ULINT, UDINT, UINT, USINT 
            TIME
        ANY_BIT
            LWORD, DWORD, WORD, BYTE, BOOL
        ANY_STRING 
            STRING
            WSTRING 
        ANY_DATE
            DATE_AND_TIME 
            DATE, TIME_OF_DAY
```

### Derived Data Types

**Derived data types** are declared using `TYPE...END_TYPE`. A direct derivation from elementary types looks like: `TYPE RU_REAL : REAL ; END_TYPE`.

#### Enumerated

```
TYPE ANALOG_SIGNAL_TYPE : 
    (SINGLE_ENDED, DIFFERENTIAL) := SINGLE_ENDED ; 
END_TYPE
```

Type prefix `ANALOG_SIGNAL_TYPE#` can be used for **enumerated** data to avoid ambiguousity. It's an **error** if sufficient type information is not provided.

The default initial value of *enumerated* data type shall be the first identifier, or a value specified by `:=`.

#### Subrange

```
TYPE ANALOG_DATA : INT (-4095..4095) ; END_TYPE
```

A **subrange** declaration specifies upper and lower limits of data type. It's an **error** if the value falls outside of the specified range of its type.

The default initial value of *subrange* data type shall be the lower limit of the subrange.

#### Struct

```
TYPE 
    ANALOG_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION :
        STRUCT
            RANGE : ANALOG_SIGNAL_RANGE ; 
            MIN_SCALE : ANALOG_DATA ; 
            MAX_SCALE : ANALOG_DATA ;
        END_STRUCT ; 
    ANALOG_16_INPUT_CONFIGURATION :
        STRUCT
            SIGNAL_TYPE : ANALOG_SIGNAL_TYPE ;
            FILTER_PARAMETER : SINT (0..99) ;
            CHANNEL : ARRAY [1..16] OF ANALOG_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION ;
        END_STRUCT ; 
END_TYPE
```

For *structs* and *arrays*, the default initial values, unless specified by `:=`, shall be the default value of underlining elementary data types.

> Default initial value for elementary shall be 0, except for `DATE` data type which is `0000-00-01`.

#### Array

```
TYPE ANALOG_16_INPUT_DATA : 
    ARRAY [1..16] OF ANALOG_DATA ; 
END_TYPE
```

The default max length of `STRING` and `WSTRING` are **implementation-dependent** unless specified, such as: `TYPE STR10 : STRING[10] := 'ABCDEF'; END_TYPE`.


## Variables

### Representation

#### Single-element Variables

A **single-element** variable is defined as a variable which represents a single data element of one of the elementary types. This subclause defines the means of representing variables **symbolically**, or **directly** represents the association of the data element with physical/logical locations in PLC's input/output/memory structure.

**Direct representation** of a *single-element* variable shall be formed by `%`, a *location prefix*, a *size prefix*, and one or more unsigned integers separated by `.`.

> An `*` shall be used in place of size prefix to indicate that the direct representation is not yet fully specified. The location of the variable shall be fully specified inside the `VAR_CONFIG...END_VAR` construction of the configuration, otherwise it's an **error**.

Location Prefix | Meaning   | Size Prefix           | Meaning
---             |   ---     |   ---                 |   ---
I               | Input     | X/None                | Single bit
Q               | Output    | B                     | Byte (8 bits)
M               | Memory    | W                     | Word (16 bits)
*               | Not yet specified | D             | Double (32 bits)
                |           | L                     | Long (64 bits)

Syntax examples:

```
%QX75 or %Q75   (* Output bit 75 *)
%IW2.5.7.1      (* Input word with physical/logical hierarchy 2.5.7.1 *)
```

> The use of hierarchical addressing to permit accessing data in another PLC shall be considered a *language extension*. The hierarchy level is **implementation-dependent**.

#### Multi-element Variables

The **multi-element variable** types defined in this standard are *arrays* and *structures*.

An **array** is an *aggregate* that consists of data objects, with identical attributes, each of which may be uniquely referenced by subscripting.

A **structured variable** is a data type consisting of a collection of named elements.

Syntax examples:

```
OUTARY[%MB6,SYM] := INARY[0] + INARY[7] - INARY[%MB6] * %IW62 ;
MODULE_5_CONFIG.SIGNAL_TYPE := SINGLE_ENDED; 
MODULE_5_CONFIG.CHANNEL[5].RANGE := BIPOLAR_10V;
```

### Initialization

When a *configuration element* is "started", each of the variables associated withe this element can take one of the following initial values:

* the value the variable had when the configuration element was “stopped” (a retained value); 
* a user-specified initial value;
* the default initial value for the variable's associated data type.

> The user can declare that a variable is to be retentive by using the `RETAIN` qualifier.

### Declaration

Variable declaration shall have the textual form of keyword `VAR`(or other var keywords), followed one or zero qualifiers, followed by one or more declarations separated by `;`, terminated by keyword `END_VAR`.

Variable declaration keywords:

| Keyword       |   Variable usage  |
| ---           |   ---             |
| `VAR`         | Internal to organization unit |
| `VAR_INPUT`   | Externally supplied, not modifiable within organization unit |
| `VAR_OUTPUT`  | Supplied by organization unit to external entities |
| `VAR_IN_OUT`  | Supplied by external entities - can be modified within organization unit |
| `VAR_EXTERNAL`| Supplied by configuration via `VAR_GLOBAL` - can be modified within organization unit |
| `VAR_GLOBAL`  | Global variable declaration |
| `VAR_ACCESS`  | Access path declaration |
| `VAR_TEMP`    | Temporary storage for variables in function blocks and programs |
| `VAR_CONFIG`  | Instance-specific initialization and location assignment. |
| `RETAIN`     | Retentive variables |
| `NON_RETAIN` | Non-retentive variables |
| `CONSTANT`   | Constant (variable cannot be modified) |
| `AT`          | Location assignment |

Within *function blocks* and *programs*, variables can be declared in `VAR_TEMP...END_VAR` construction. These variables are initialized at each *invocation* of an instance.

The scope of declarations shall be *local* to the program organization unit in which it's declared. `VAR_GLOBAL...END_VAR` variables are only accessible via a `VAR_EXTERNAL` declaration. The type declaration in `VAR_EXTERNAL` shall agree with that of `VAR_GLOBAL`, otherwise it's an **error**.

#### Type Assignment

The assignment of a physical or logical address to a symbolically represented variable shall be accomplished by the use of the `AT` keyword. Where no such assignment is made, automatic allocation of the variable to an appropriate location in the programmable controller memory shall be provided.

Syntax examples:

```
VAR RETAIN
    AT %IW6.2 : WORD;       
    LIM_SW_S5 AT %IX27 : BOOL;
    INARY AT %IW6 : ARRAY [0..9] OF INT;
    THREE : ARRAY[1..5,1..10,1..8] OF INT;
END_VAR
```

#### Initial Value Assignment

Initial values can also be specified by using the instance-specific initialization feature provided by the `VAR_CONFIG...END_VAR` construct. Instance-specific initial values always override type-specific initial values.

> Initial values cannot be given in `VAR_EXTERNAL` declarations.

Snytax examples:

```
VAR
    VALVE_POS AT %QW28 : INT := 100;
    OUTARY AT %QW6 : ARRAY[0..9] OF INT := [10(1)];
    OKAY : STRING[10] := 'OK';
    TBT : ARRAY [1..2,1..3] OF INT := [1,2,3(4),6] ;
END_VAR

(* struct declaration *)
TYPE 
    ANALOG_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION :
        STRUCT
            RANGE : ANALOG_SIGNAL_RANGE ; 
            MIN_SCALE : ANALOG_DATA ; 
            MAX_SCALE : ANALOG_DATA ;
        END_STRUCT ; 
    ANALOG_16_INPUT_CONFIGURATION :
        STRUCT
            SIGNAL_TYPE : ANALOG_SIGNAL_TYPE ;
            FILTER_PARAMETER : SINT (0..99) ;
            CHANNEL : ARRAY [1..16] OF ANALOG_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION ;
        END_STRUCT ; 
END_TYPE

(* struct initialization *)
VAR MODULE_8_CONFIG: 
    ANALOG_16_INPUT_CONFIGURATION := (
        SIGNAL_TYPE := DIFFERENTIAL, 
        CHANNEL := [
            4(
                (RANGE := UNIPOLAR_1_5V)
            ), 
            (
                RANGE:= BIPOLAR_10_V,
                MIN_SCALE := 0, 
                MAX_SCALE := 500
            )
        ]
    );
END_VAR

(* function block initialization *)
VAR TempLoop : 
    PID := (
        PropBand := 2.5, 
        Integral := T#5s
    );
END_VAR
```
